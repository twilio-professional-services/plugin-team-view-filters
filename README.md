# Custom Twilio Flex Team View Filters

## Flex Plugins
Twilio Flex Plugins allow you to customize the appearance and behavior of [Twilio Flex](https://www.twilio.com/flex). If you want to learn more about the capabilities and how to use the API, check out our [Flex documentation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex).

## Overview
The Twilio Flex Team View allows for real-time monitoring of Flex agents and supports filtering those agents based on Twilio TaskRouter worker attributes. This plugin provides samples for creating three types of Team View filters:

## Requirements

### Team View Filters

To use this plugin, you should enable the Team View Filters feature on your Flex instance, and you can do that on the [pre-release features page](https://flex.twilio.com/admin/features/). On the Feature Settings page, go to the _Pilot_ tab, and enable the _Advanced Teams Views Filters_.

## Setup

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) as well as [`npm`](https://npmjs.com) installed.

Afterwards, install the dependencies by running `npm install`:

```bash
cd 

# If you use npm
npm install
```

## Development

In order to develop locally, you can use the Webpack Dev Server by running:

```bash
npm start
```

This will automatically start up the Webpack Dev Server and open the browser for you. Your app will run on `http://localhost:3000`. If you want to change that you can do this by setting the `PORT` environment variable:

```bash
PORT=3001 npm start
```

When you make changes to your code, the browser window will be automatically refreshed.

## Deploy

When you are ready to deploy your plugin, in your terminal run:

```bash
twilio flex:plugins:deploy --major --changelog "Notes for this version"
```

If the deployment succeeds, you will get a success message like the example below. Make sure to run the "Next Steps" section to enable the newly published version of your plugin:

For more details on deploying your plugin, refer to the [deploying your plugin guide](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex/developer/plugins/cli/deploy-and-release).

Note: Common packages like `React`, `ReactDOM`, `Redux` and `ReactRedux` are not bundled with the build because they are treated as external dependencies so the plugin will depend on Flex to provide them globally.
